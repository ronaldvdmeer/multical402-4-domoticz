# multical402-4-domoticz

**Due to the fact that I no longer use domoticz but instead switched to Home Assistant ive archived this repostory. Perhaps have a look at https://github.com/gertvdijk/PyKMP**
  
This script is developed for use with domoticz and a Kamstrup Multical 402 (city heating)  
  
Dependency:
 * Software: linux, python3 and python3-serial  
 * Hardware: IR Optical Probe IEC1107 IEC61107  
  
```
usage: multical.py [-h] -d DEVICE [--ip IP] [--port PORT] [--verbose]
                   [--debug] [--test_kamstrup] [--test_domoticz]
                   [values [values ...]]

positional arguments:
  values                idx:CommandNr:opt or idx:CommandNR:opt:idx2

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        Device to use. Example: /dev/ttyUSB0
  --ip IP               Domoticz ip address. Defaults to localhost
  --port PORT           Domoticz port. Defaults to 8080
  --verbose             Make this script more verbose
  --debug               Make this script print debug output
  --test_kamstrup       Test the IR interface of the Kamstrup and exit
  --test_domoticz       Test the connection with Domoticz and exit

Values are expected in the format:
   "idx:CommandNr:opt" (for opt=0) 
   "idx:CommandNr:opt:idx2" (for opt=1 or opt=2). 
CommandNr can be found using the --test_kamstrup option 
idx can be found in the "Setup > Devices" list of the Domoticz web interface,
  or by using the --test_domoticz option. 

Devices (Virtual Sensors) must be defined before they can be used! To do this,
   start by adding a "Dummy" type hardware entry. This Dummy hardware then allows
   for creating "Create Virtual Sensors". 
   For example, a Virtual Sensor of type "Custom Sensor" with Axis Label "Gj" can 
   be used for recording the "Heat Energy (E1)".

opt=0 writes the value from "CommandNr" to Domoticz device "idx".
opt=1 takes the value from  "CommandNr", subtracts the value of Domoticz "idx2", and stores this in "idx".
opt=2 takes the value from "CommandNr", adds the value of Domoticz device "idx2", and stores this in "idx".
```

You must atleast execute this script once every 30 minutes or else the IR port on the Kamstrup will be disabled until you press a physical button on the device itself. This can be done with cron: `crontab -e` and then add something like:

`*/20 *  * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script/multical402-4-domoticz.py -d /dev/ttyUSB1 88:60:0 89:80:0`
